# MagRoader's Journal Sorting

Allows for better sorting of Journal directories (or any auto-sorted directory, really) for strings that contain numbers.

For example, say you have some Journal Entries, and you expect them to look like so:

- 2 - The Alley
- 3 - The Rooftops
- ...
- 20 - The Dungeon
- 21 - The Rift
- 22 - The Elemental Plane of Fire

The default sort order would be confusing:

- 2 - The Alley
- 20 - The Dungeon
- 21 - The Rift
- 22 - The Elemental Plane of Fire
- 3 - The Rooftops
- ...

That's no good! The Roottops are supposed to go after The Alley, not way after everything else!
